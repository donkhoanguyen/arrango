## Dependencies Between Tasks
The roadmap is meticulously structured to ensure a logical flow of tasks. Initial data source analysis lays the groundwork for schema matching automation. The successful development of schema matching is crucial for the subsequent automation of data transformation and ETL processes. The functionality of the data cleansing module is contingent upon the integration of transformation rules. The design and implementation of the user interface are dependent on the completion of core framework functionalities. Finally, cloud integration cannot proceed until the core framework and UI design are finalized.

## Projected vs. Actual Completion Times
Tracking projected versus actual completion times is vital for identifying potential delays and initiating corrective actions. Each milestone will be monitored weekly, with detailed reports generated to assess progress. Adjustments to timelines will be made as required to maintain project momentum and ensure timely delivery.

## Story Points / Effort Estimations
Effort estimations are quantified using story points, a measure of workload that accounts for complexity and time investment:

- **Schema Matching Automation**: 50 story points
- **Data Transformation and ETL Automation**: 70 story points
- **Data Cleansing Module Development**: 60 story points
- **User Interface Design and Implementation**: 40 story points
- **Cloud Integration and Deployment**: 30 story points
- **Continuous Learning and Feedback Loop**: 20 story points

These estimations guide resource allocation and task prioritization, ensuring a balanced distribution of efforts across the team.

## Conclusion
The roadmap for the Intelligent Data Integration Framework is designed to facilitate efficient project execution, with clear milestones, dependencies, and effort estimations. Continuous monitoring and adjustment will ensure that the project adheres to its strategic objectives, delivering a robust, intelligent framework that transforms data integration processes.
