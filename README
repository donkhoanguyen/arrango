# Project Plan

## Overview
We are building an application that supports task planning using Critical Path Management (CPM) and supports employee promotion using the HITS (Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search) graph algorithm.

## Features

### Task Planning with CPM
- **Task Creation**: Users can create tasks with dependencies.
- **CPM Calculation**: The application will calculate the critical path for the tasks.
- **Task Scheduling**: Users can view and manage the schedule of tasks based on the critical path.

### Employee Promotion with HITS
- **Employee Graph**: The application will maintain a graph of employees and their interactions.
- **HITS Algorithm**: The application will use the HITS algorithm to rank employees based on their importance and influence.
- **Promotion Recommendations**: The application will provide recommendations for employee promotions based on the HITS rankings.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js for building the user interface.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for handling API requests.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing task and employee data.
- **Graph Processing**: Neo4j for handling graph algorithms and data.

## Milestones
1. **Initial Setup**
    - Set up the project repository and development environment.
    - Create initial project structure.

2. **Task Planning Module**
    - Implement task creation and dependency management.
    - Develop CPM calculation logic.
    - Create task scheduling interface.

3. **Employee Promotion Module**
    - Implement employee graph data structure.
    - Develop HITS algorithm for ranking employees.
    - Create promotion recommendation interface.

4. **Integration and Testing**
    - Integrate frontend and backend components.
    - Perform thorough testing of all features.
    - Optimize performance and fix any bugs.

5. **Deployment**
    - Deploy the application to a cloud platform.
    - Set up continuous integration and deployment pipelines.

## Conclusion
This application aims to streamline task planning and employee promotion processes using advanced algorithms. By leveraging CPM and HITS, we can provide valuable insights and recommendations to users.
