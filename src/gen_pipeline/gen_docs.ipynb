AI models will be trained to understand and map different data schemas, making intelligent suggestions for integration. Data transformation rules can be generated and applied automatically, streamlining the ETL process. The cleansing module will detect anomalies, missing values, and duplicates, offering automated corrections. The user interface will provide a drag-and-drop feature for creating and managing integration workflows, with real-time monitoring and analytics on data flow and quality. The framework should be cloud-agnostic, supporting integration with popular cloud providers and on-premises systems. Additionally, a feedback loop will enable continuous learning and improvement of the AI models by incorporating user corrections and preferences.\n","\"\"\"\n"],"metadata":{"id":"FBthPxTC-7yM","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1740800659058,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"Vuong Ho","userId":"00142954554496901229"}}},"execution_count":32,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Now load the list of employees"],"metadata":{"id":"ksVAPA9aQ7ZX"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["os.environ[\"DATABASE_HOST\"] = \"https://b61c3b83bfe6.arangodb.cloud:8529\"\n","os.environ[\"DATABASE_USERNAME\"] = \"root\"\n","os.environ[\"DATABASE_PASSWORD\"] = \"RHr0KzkRUVlp61IisH8G\"\n","os.environ[\"DATABASE_NAME\"] = \"DAC_devops_log\""],"metadata":{"id":"4nSb7JqsRBu0","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1740800659061,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"Vuong Ho","userId":"00142954554496901229"}}},"execution_count":33,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from arango import ArangoClient\n","\n","# Initialize the ArangoDB client\n","client = ArangoClient(hosts=\"https://b61c3b83bfe6.arangodb.cloud:8529\")\n","\n","# Connect to the database\n","db = client.db(\"DAC_devops_log\", username='root', password=\"RHr0KzkRUVlp61IisH8G\")\n","\n","# Define the AQL query\n","query = 'FOR employee IN employee RETURN employee'\n","\n","# Execute the query\n","cursor = db.aql.execute(query)\n","\n","teams = {}\n","\n","# Iterate over the cursor and print each document\n","for employee in cursor:\n","  employee_team = employee['Team']\n","  if employee_team not in teams:\n","    teams[employee_team] = []\n","  teams[employee_team].append((employee[\"FirstName\"], employee[\"LastName\"], \"Role: \" + employee[\"Role\"]))\n","\n","print(teams.keys())\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Wn5KxyLSRxp1","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1740800659364,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":301,"user":{"displayName":"Vuong Ho","userId":"00142954554496901229"}},"outputId":"e1b4bd10-d027-4a4a-ea62-e894402cd198"},"execution_count":34,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["dict_keys(['Leadership', 'Business Intelligence', 'Data Engineering', 'Data Science', 'Data Governance'])\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["selected_team = [\"Leadership\", \"Business Intelligence\"]\n","team_prompt = \"\"\n","\n","for team in selected_team:\n","  team_prompt += \"\\nTeam\" + team + \": \" + str(teams[team])\n","\n","print(team_prompt)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"4JWYgjIuS6xe","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1740800659366,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":18,"user":{"displayName":"Vuong Ho","userId":"00142954554496901229"}},"outputId":"4427b4c3-9cd0-4353-86ee-a48d22684b88"},"execution_count":35,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n","TeamLeadership: [('Stephanie', 'Harris', 'Role: Director'), ('Justin', 'Lee', 'Role: Vice-Director')]\n","TeamBusiness Intelligence: [('Timothy', 'Johnson', 'Role: Business Intelligence Lead'), ('Cynthia', 'Harris', 'Role: BI Analyst'), ('Kathleen', 'Stewart', 'Role: BI Analyst'), ('Robert', 'Stewart', 'Role: BI Analyst'), ('Sarah', 'Jones', 'Role: BI Analyst'), ('Susan', 'Moore', 'Role: BI Analyst'), ('Linda', 'Parker', 'Role: BI Analyst'), ('Emily', 'Collins', 'Role: BI Analyst'), ('Jennifer', 'Rogers', 'Role: BI Analyst'), ('Rebecca', 'Richardson', 'Role: BI Analyst')]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Now we get to create documents"],"metadata":{"id":"5yv0F3apZml1"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\n","core_prompt = (\n","        \"system\",\n","        \"You are tasked with generating artificial documents for a data engineering company project.
